## üéØ What is GamerShop?

GamerShop is an online video game store built with the most modern technologies in the React ecosystem. The main goal of this project wasn't just to create a pretty interface, but to obsess over **performance** and **best practices**.

Here you'll find a product catalog, a dynamic filtering system, and a persistent shopping cart, all built on a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## üïπÔ∏è Key Features

- **Dynamic Catalog:** Browse a list of products loaded from an API.
- **Smart Filters:** Filter games by genre and watch the URL and UI sync instantly.
- **"Infinite" Pagination:** Load more products with the "See More" button without losing context.
- **Persistent Cart:** Your selection is saved in `localStorage` so you don't lose your products between sessions.
- **Extreme Optimization:** Heavy use of `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and rendering strategies for a smooth, flicker-free user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** A seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
